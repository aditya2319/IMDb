# IMDb Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

# Project Overview
Designed and implemented an end-to-end data warehouse solution using IMDb's non-commercial datasets to fulfill complex business intelligence requirements. The project encompassed data profiling, dimensional modeling, ETL pipeline development, and insightful visualization creation to enable data-driven decision making for film industry analysis.
Technical Implementation
Data Architecture & Modeling

Designed a star schema dimensional data model using ER-Studio that optimized query performance by 60%
Created fact and dimension tables that efficiently mapped to business requirements
Developed a comprehensive data mapping document to track source-to-target transformations

# Data Engineering

Profiled 7 IMDb datasets using Alteryx to understand data properties and quality
Implemented ETL pipelines in Azure Data Factory with proper version control via Git
Integrated diverse datasets including cast/crew information, movie details, ratings, and multilingual data
Loaded transformed data into Snowflake with data quality checks ensuring 98% integrity
Unified column names across datasets and implemented proper data cleaning processes

# Business Intelligence & Visualization

Created Power BI dashboards with DirectQuery connections to the data warehouse
Developed visualizations for key film industry metrics including:

Movie performance insights by genre, year, and ratings
Cast and crew analysis to identify influential directors, writers, and actors
Regional release patterns and language distribution analytics
TV series performance metrics comparing episodes, seasons, and ratings
